$\mathbf{FOCUSES}$
===
1. $\mathbf{CHARACTERS}$ Do the characters have special personalities (aka not only consist of clich√©s)? How approachable are the characters? How do they develop?
2. $\mathbf{MUSIC}$ How good is the music *and* does it fit the content?
3. $\mathbf{PLOT}$ Does the plot follow a clear thread? Does it remain exciting and unpredictable?
4. $\mathbf{IDEA/WORLDBUILDING}$ How well thought out is the world or the idea? Does it all make sense? How well is it explained and integrated into the plot?
