2. **Music** How good is the music *and* does it fit the content?
3. **Plot** Does the plot follow a clear thread? Does it remain exciting and unpredictable?
4. **Idea/Worldbuilding** How well thought out is the world or the idea? Does it all make sense? How well is it explained and integrated into the plot?
